<h2> Approach </h2>
    For this example I take my swing at the the Adventure Works database (sales data from 2015-2017).

I know it is an overused dataset, but its for good reason.

My goal is to provide a "single" page report with minimalistic styling that shows high level metrics but also gives some insight into granular trends.
  </br>
<h3>Analyzing;</h3>

<p>
First things first, getting a good picture of the data istelf I see there are 3 tables for sales - one for each year. We also see many dimension tables Category, SubCategory, Products etc. 
Now I make the assumtion that this model will star off the sales table(s).
We are going to want to combine them together to get a single fact table for the model to be built as a star schema. 

I also notice 2 tables for the product category; Product Categories and Product Subcategories.

Another fact table is also present, the Returns table. I keep that in mind later for when I am modeling.
</p>

<h3>Querying;</h3>
<p>
As mentioned before, I append the three sales tables into a single fact table 'Sales Master'.

I merge product categories onto the product subcategories table, creating a single dim table for category.

I get a resfresh date using the below query

	let
    Source = DateTime.LocalNow(),
    #"Converted to Table" = #table(1, {{Source}}),
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Converted to Table",{{"Column1", type datetime}}),
    #"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Changed Type",{{"Column1", "Last Refresh"}})
in
    #"Renamed Columns"
  </p>	


<h3>Modeling;</h3>

<p>
I create a star schema stemming off the sales master table. The connections are quite obvious thanks to the good construction of the dataset. I join the Date table (which i create using DAX below) to the Sales Master  - using the Date column and OrderDate respectively. I add a inactive join as well but use StockDate from sales master instead. This will be useful If I need to reference it in a DAX query.
</p>


<h5>DAX Tables;</h5>
<p>
I create 2 DAX tables, a date and a version table.

Date = 
VAR MinYear = YEAR ( MIN ( Calendar[Date] ) )
VAR MaxYear = YEAR ( MAX ( Calendar[Date]) )
RETURN
ADDCOLUMNS (
    FILTER (
        CALENDARAUTO( ),
        AND ( YEAR ( [Date] ) >= MinYear, YEAR ( [Date] ) <= MaxYear )
    ),
    "Calendar Year", "CY " & YEAR ( [Date] ),
    "Month Name", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmmm" ),
    "Month Short Name", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmm" ),
    "Month Number", MONTH ( [Date] ),
    "Month Year Number", MONTH ( [Date] ) & YEAR ( [Date] ),
    "Quarter" , SWITCH(MONTH([Date]),
                1,"Q1",2,"Q1",3,"Q1",
                4,"Q2",6,"Q2",6,"Q2",
                7,"Q3",8,"Q4",9,"Q4",
                10,"Q4",11,"Q4","Q4"),
    "Current Date", FORMAT(TODAY(), "mm/dd/yyyy")
    )
    
Versioning Table = 
DATATABLE(
    "Version", STRING,
    "Version Date", DATETIME,
    {
        {"v1.0"  ,  "8/10/2023" }
    }
)

  </p>


<h3>DAX Measures;</h3>
<p>
I added a few measures on the Sales table, some major ones are;

Net Sales = 
    SUMX(
        'Sales Master', 
        'Sales Master'[OrderQuantity] * RELATED(Products[ProductPrice])
    )

COGS = 
	SUMX(
		'Sales Master', 
		'Sales Master'[OrderQuantity] * RELATED(Products[ProductCost])
	)

Gross Profit = 
    CALCULATE(
        ([Net Sales] - [COGS]) 
    )
	
	
Gross Margin % = 
    CALCULATE(
          ([COGS] / [Net Sales] ) + 0
    ) // * 100
	
	
  </p>

<h3>Visaulizing;</h3>
<p>
  Basics page elements include last refresh card, Title and background rectangles for the headers and footer.
Light grey background to make the visual section pop. Filter Icon on the left side above the buttons.
Small icon in the bottom left for comfirming versioning.

Large custom cards in the second header for the 4 most important figures.
5 cards on the next row down, with some helpful numbers to keep in mind while examining the visuals.



Using Bookmarks allowed for the app-like changing of the visuals based on the right-hand sides button's input.
In Addition, I decided to go with a slicer panel, as well as a version tracker (small circle with an illegible "I" in the bottom right of the page). 

Another contributor to the single page attempt is custom cards. I always find people love icons, and overlaying shapes, text box's, no background card's gives off a professional look that should be its own visual.
